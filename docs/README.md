# Tenderely

Welcome to the Tenderely Core documentation!

Tenderely Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent
of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications
written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications,
Tenderely serves blockchain applications.

More formally, Tenderely Core performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
State Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines.
For more background, see [What is
Tenderely?](introduction/what-is-tendermint.md).

To get started quickly with an example application, see the [quick start guide](introduction/quick-start.md).

To learn about application development on Tenderely, see the [Application Blockchain Interface](spec/abci/).

For more details on using Tenderely, see the respective documentation for
[Tenderely Core](tendermint-core/), [benchmarking and monitoring](tools/), and [network deployments](networks/).
